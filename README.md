# Simple-Space-Invaders
Beginner-level space invaders' inspired game. The game is too big (94mb) to be put here. The goal was to:
1. Make a game.
2. Turn it into executables.

I believe I have completed the goal, regardless of the aesthetic and marketability of the game.

Must install:
pygame

Includes:
1. A Player
   - Controls with left and right arrow.
   - Shoots with spacebar.
2. An enemy
   - 1 enemy at a time.
   - It gets closer to the player if it hasn't been shot by player.
3. Bullets
    - Limited bullets on screen at a time.
    - Player cannot spam the spacebar to shoots unlimited bullet.
